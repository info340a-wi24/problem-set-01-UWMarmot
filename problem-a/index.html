  <h1>The Ancestor</h1>
  <h2>(From Darkest Dungeon)</h2>
  <img src = 'img/ancestor.jpg' alt = 'The Ancestor, Darkest Dungeon'>
  <p>
    The Ancestor serves as narrator, teacher, and antagonist of the video game
    <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkest_Dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a></cite>.
    You are introduced to the ancestor at the onset of the game, as you have received a letter
    informing you that you have inherited his estate, under the condition that you help
    preserve the family name by freeing the estate from the grasp of the old gods he so firmly landed
    it in. Over the game you discover writings from the ancestor explaining how he managed to bring
    such corruption to life, and he also acts as a narrator, encouraging and admonishing your choices
    as you explore the sprawling, rotten, estate.

  <h2>Reasons to respect The Ancestor</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      He's ambitious. It takes a lot of time and effort to dig deep enough
      that you uncover eldritch crypts, and he didn't stop until he succeeded.
    </li>
    <li>
      Most of the people who worked for him are alive! When a physical incarnation
      of madness wakes up under your house its unrealistic to suspect a high survival rate,
      but due to what we can only imagine were heroic acts by The Ancestor, most of the estates
      employees are alive!*
       *(if horribly mutated and angry)
    </li>
    <li class = 'wine'>
      He's a gourmet, having even invented his own brand of wine named 'The Blood',
      renouned for its almost putrid iron flavor.
    </li>
  </ol>
